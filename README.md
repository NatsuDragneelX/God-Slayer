CSC 3380 Calculator project

* Open the calculator code file in Visual Studio Code.
* Visual Studio Code will automatically create a terminal window at the file's location.
* Use this terminal window to run and test your code.

* This advanced calculator is capable of performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus on both positive and negative values.
* It features a table of predefined mathematical constants, including pi, e, i, square root of 2 and 3, tau, phi, and a recursive Fibonacci sequence. These constants can be invoked directly in the calculations.
* To use the calculator, input any valid mathematical expression. For instance, `pi%5;`. The console will then display the result of the provided expression.
* Please note that every equation must be terminated with a semicolon (`;`). Failure to do so will result in a compilation error.

Input: x = 5;
Expected Output: 5 (assignment should return the assigned value)
Input: x;
Expected Output: 5 (previously assigned value)

**Test Case 4: Complex Expressions**
Input: 3 + 4 * 5;
Expected Output: 23 (testing order of operations)
Input: (3 + 4) * 5;
Expected Output: 35 (testing parenthesis impact on order of operations)

**Test Case 5: Division by Zero Handling**
Input: 10 / 0;
Expected Output: Runtime error: Divide by zero

Input: log(e);
Expected Output: 1

**Test Case 10: Nested Function Calls**
Input: sqrt(25) + exp(log(4));
Expected Output: 7 (since exp(log(4)) simplifies to 4)

**Test Case 11: Error Handling for Functions**
Input: sqrt(-1);
Expected Output: Runtime error: Square root of negative number
Input: log(0);
Expected Output: Runtime error: Logarithm of non-positive number
